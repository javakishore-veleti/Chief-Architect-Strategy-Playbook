# Technical Debt Management Strategy

## Vision

To proactively identify, measure, and manage technical debt in a way that balances innovation velocity with long-term sustainability, system health, and architectural integrity. The goal is to make technical debt a visible, governable part of IT strategy—treated as a risk asset rather than a hidden liability.

## Strategic Principles

- **Transparency**: Make technical debt visible across all layers of the architecture and lifecycle.
- **Intentionality**: Not all debt is bad—take on debt consciously with clear repayment plans.
- **Prioritization**: Align debt remediation with business value, risk, and system criticality.
- **Continuous Management**: Embed debt tracking in delivery workflows, not just one-time audits.
- **Architectural Integrity**: Use EA governance to prevent debt from eroding architectural standards.

## Strategic Objectives

- Define a classification framework for different types of technical debt (code, architectural, data, infrastructure).
- Integrate debt tracking into backlog management and product planning.
- Establish metrics and dashboards to quantify and monitor technical debt.
- Create debt repayment policies and embed them into release and architecture governance.
- Enable engineering teams to participate in identifying and remediating tech debt.

## Execution Roadmap

| Phase       | Timeline | Key Deliverables |
|-------------|----------|------------------|
| **Define**   | Q1       | Tech debt taxonomy, tagging framework, roles & responsibilities |
| **Measure**  | Q2       | Baseline inventory, tooling integration (e.g., SonarQube, CodeScene), EA heatmaps |
| **Integrate**| Q3       | Backlog prioritization models, architecture review triggers |
| **Optimize** | Q4       | Automated tracking, leadership dashboards, periodic retrospectives |

## KPIs & Metrics

- Total estimated debt (effort-hours or cost equivalent)
- % of backlog allocated to debt remediation vs. new features
- Change failure rate due to architectural fragility
- Code health score or architecture complexity index
- Trend of unresolved architectural review violations

## Strategic Patterns / Case Studies

- **Tech Debt Registers**: Centralized repository to track debt items, ownership, and repayment status.
- **Quality Gates**: CI/CD gates that enforce minimum code coverage, complexity, and maintainability scores.
- **Architecture Fitness Functions**: Automate checks for architectural conformance over time.
- **Refactoring Sprints**: Time-boxed, periodic efforts focused solely on debt reduction.
