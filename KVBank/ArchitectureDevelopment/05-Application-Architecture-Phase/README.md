# Architecture Development - Application Architecture

## Steps for Application Architecture

1. Select reference models, viewpoints and tools
2. Develop baseline application architecture description
3. Develop target application architecture description
4. Perform gap analysis
5. Define candidate roadmap components
6. Define candidate roadmap components
7. Resolve impacts across the architecture landscape
8. Conduct formal stakeholder review
9. Finalize application architecture
10. Create architecture definition document.
