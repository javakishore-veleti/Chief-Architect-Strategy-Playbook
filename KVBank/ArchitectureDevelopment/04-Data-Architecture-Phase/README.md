# Architecture Development - Data Architecture Phase

## Steps for Data Architecture Phase

1. Select reference models, viewpoints and tools
2. Develop baseline architecture description
3. Develop target architecture descriptino
4. Perform gap analysis
5. Define candidate roadmap components
6. Resolve impacts across the architecture landscape
7. Conduct formal stakeholder review
8. Finalize Data Architecture
9. Create architecture definition document

## Outputs from Data Architecture Phase

1. Refined Phase A Deliverables
2. Define architecture definition document
    a. Baseline data architecture, approved version
    b. Target data architecture, approved version
3. Draft architecture requirements specification - gap analysis
4. Data architecture components of an architecture roadmap    

## Artifacts Produced

### Catalogs
1. Data entity/data component catalog

## Matrices
1. Data entity/business functions  matrix
2. Application/Data matrix

## Diagrams
1. Conceptual data diagram
2. Logical Data diagram
3. Data dissemination diagram
4. Data Security Diagram
5. Data Migration Diagram
6. Data lifecycle diagram


# Phase C: Data Architecture - Part 1 (Steps, Outputs, and Core Architecture):

## Contents:

1. Introduction and Purpose - Objectives, scope, relationship to Phase B
2. Reference Models, Viewpoints and Tools - BIAN, ISO 20022, FIBO, GDPR, tools (Kafka, Delta Lake, etc.)
3. Baseline Data Architecture - Current data landscape, quality assessment, governance gaps
4. Target Data Architecture - Principles, domains, platform architecture
5. Gap Analysis - Capability gaps, domain gaps, technology gaps
6. Candidate Roadmap Components - 12 work packages (DA-01 to DA-12), €10M over 18 months
7. Architecture Definition Document - Components and decisions
8. Requirements Specification - Functional and non-functional requirements
