# Architecture Development - Data Architecture Phase

## Steps for Data Architecture Phase

1. Select reference models, viewpoints and tools
2. Develop baseline architecture description
3. Develop target architecture descriptino
4. Perform gap analysis
5. Define candidate roadmap components
6. Resolve impacts across the architecture landscape
7. Conduct formal stakeholder review
8. Finalize Data Architecture
9. Create architecture definition document
