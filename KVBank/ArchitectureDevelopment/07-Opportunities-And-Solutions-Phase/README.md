# Architecture Development - Opportunities & Solutions

## Purpose
1. Generate the initial architecture roadmap
2. Identify if transition architectures are required
3. Define Solution Building Blocks (SBBs) - these are reusable components - generalized and re=used and other places

## Steps for Opportunities & Solutions

1. Determine key corporate change attributes
2. Determine business constraints for implementation
3. Review and consolidate gap analysis from Phases B (Business Architecture) to D (Technology Architecture)
4. Review consolidated requirements across business functions
5. Consolidate and reconcile interoperability requirements
6. Refine and validate dependencies
7. Confirm readiness and risks for business transformation
8. Formulate implementation and migration strategy
9. Identify and group major work packages
10. Identify transition architectures
11. Create the architecture roadmap & implementation and migration plan

## Output of Opportunities & Solutions

1. Refined Phase A Deliverables
2. Draft architecture definition document
    a. Incl. baseline and target BDAT architecture approved
    b. Inc. transition architecture views
3. Draft architecture requirements specification - incl. gap analysis
4. Capability assessments
5. Architecture roadmap
    a. Incl. work package portflio
6. Implenetation & Migration Plan, draft version
