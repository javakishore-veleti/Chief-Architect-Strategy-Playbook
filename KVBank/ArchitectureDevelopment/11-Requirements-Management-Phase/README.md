# Architecture Development - Requirements Management Phase

- Sits in the center of architecture development.
- Continous process of handling change during any phase of architecture development process
- Being able to handle chage at any time is crucial for the ADM to succeed.

## Purpose

1. Ensure the process is sustained through all the phases of architecture development

```text
Requirements Management Phase is now COMPLETE!
This completes the central hub of the TOGAF ADM - the continuous process that enables change handling at any time throughout architecture development.
Key Outcomes:

806 total requirements managed
8 active change requests in process
6 baselines maintained
94% traceability coverage
8-day average change cycle time
```
