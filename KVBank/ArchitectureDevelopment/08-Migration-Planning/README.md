# Architecture Development - Migration and Planning

## Purpose

1. Finalize the architecture roadmap and migration plan
2. Ensure migration plan is aligned with enterprise approach to change
3. Ensure business value and cost of work package is understood

## Steps to Migration and Planning

1. Confirm management framework interactions (ITIL, PMP, etc)
2. Assign business value to each work package (tangible business outcome - examples are permanently cust 1 million in cost or add 1 million more to the revenue)
3. Estimate resource requirements, project timings, etc
4. Priortize the migration projects via cost/benefit assessment and risk validation (quick wins, easy to do etc prirotize them earlier, or once are risky or doing unnecessary things or doing harder things first)
5. Confirm architecture roadmap and update architecture definition document 
6. Generate implementation and migration plan
7. Complete the architecture development cycle, lessons learned (like developing additional architecture capability in future doing some introspection, will you do things differently, need additional training or need further to tailor the architecture development frameworks etc) - this includes hading over the work to other teams like project teams and development teams and for others to implement (includess business processes team).

## Outputs of Migration and Planning

1. Implementation and Migration Plan, Approved version
2. Finalized architecture definition document
3. Finalized architecture requirements
4. Finalized architecture roadmap
5. Reusable ABBs
6. Requests for Architecture Work for next ADM cycle (if any)
7. Implementation of Governance model
8. Change requests for architecture capability from lessons learned
