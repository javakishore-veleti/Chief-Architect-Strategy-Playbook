# Architecture Development - Migration and Planning

## Purpose

1. Finalize the architecture roadmap and migration plan
2. Ensure migration plan is aligned with enterprise approach to change
3. Ensure business value and cost of work package is understood

## Steps to Migration and Planning

1. Confirm management framework interactions (ITIL, PMP, etc)
2. Assign business value to each work package (tangible business outcome - examples are permanently cust 1 million in cost or add 1 million more to the revenue)
3. Estimate resource requirements, project timings, etc
4. Priortize the migration projects via cost/benefit assessment and risk validation (quick wins, easy to do etc prirotize them earlier, or once are risky or doing unnecessary things or doing harder things first)
5. Confirm architecture roadmap and update architecture definition document 
6. Generate implementation and migration plan
7. Complete the architecture development cycle, lessons learned (like developing additional architecture capability in future doing some introspection, will you do things differently, need additional training or need further to tailor the architecture development frameworks etc) - this includes hading over the work to other teams like project teams and development teams and for others to implement (includess business processes team).

## Outputs of Migration and Planning

1. Implementation and Migration Plan, Approved version
2. Finalized architecture definition document
3. Finalized architecture requirements
4. Finalized architecture roadmap
5. Reusable ABBs
6. Requests for Architecture Work for next ADM cycle (if any)
7. Implementation of Governance model
8. Change requests for architecture capability from lessons learned

Contents:
1. Introduction and Purpose

Purpose of Phase F: Finalize roadmap, ensure alignment with enterprise change approach
7 Objectives: Framework alignment, value assignment, resource estimation, prioritization, roadmap finalization, migration plan, ADM cycle completion

2. Management Framework Interactions

Framework Alignment Matrix (TOGAF, SAFe 6.0, ITIL 4, PMP/PRINCE2, DevOps/SRE, COBIT 2019)
SAFe Implementation Structure (Portfolio → Solution Train → ARTs → Teams)

ART 1: Platform (WP-01, 03, 10-12)
ART 2: Banking (WP-02, 04-09)
PI Cadence: 10 weeks, 8 PIs over 24 months


ITIL 4 Integration (8 practices mapped)
Governance Integration Points (Steering Committee, Architecture Board, CAB, PI Planning)
Framework Responsibility Matrix (RACI-style)

3. Business Value Assignment (12 Work Packages)

Business Value Framework (Revenue, Cost, Risk, Customer, Strategic)
Detailed value breakdown for each work package:

WP-07 Wealth Management: €8M investment → €15M/year (188% ROI)
WP-08 Partner Ecosystem: €2M investment → €5M/year (250% ROI)
WP-04 Digital Channels: €4M investment → €5M/year (125% ROI)
WP-06 Risk & Compliance: €4M investment → €5M/year (125% ROI)


Total: €42M investment → €46.7M/year value (111% ROI, 0.9 year payback)
Tangible business outcomes for each WP

4. Resource Requirements Estimation

Resource Categories (Permanent, Contractors, SI Partners, Vendors)
Detailed resource breakdown for all 12 work packages:

Roles, internal vs contractor, duration, FTE-months
Cost breakdown (labor, infrastructure, licenses)


Resource Summary: 2,347 total FTE-months

Backend Development: 32%
Frontend/Mobile: 17%
QA/Testing: 13%
Data/Analytics: 12%


Resource Timeline by Quarter (60 FTEs Q1 Y1 → 144 FTEs peak Q1 Y2 → 67 FTEs Q4 Y2)

5. Project Timings and Scheduling

24-month Program Schedule (ASCII Gantt chart)
Critical Path Analysis: WP-01 → WP-02/WP-03 → WP-07 → Target State
12 Key Milestones with dates and criteria
PI Planning Calendar (8 PIs)
