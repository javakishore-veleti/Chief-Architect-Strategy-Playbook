# Architecture Development - Architecture Change Management

## Purpose

1. Maintain Architecture Lifecyle
2. Execute Architecture Goverance

## Steps for Architecture Change Management

1. Establish Value Realization Process - you did analysis before phases and said this is the value of work product and if we spend money we should be able to recude operations cost or increase more revune thorugh these solutions and realize the value
2. Deploy Monitoring Tools
3. Manage Risks
4. Provide Analysis for Architecture Change Management - like if we need to add 3rd party software and how does it fits into the overall architecture
5. Develop Change Requirements to Meet Performance Targets - you did the work and not quite living upto the expectations and then you need to trigger change management like we undersestimated this or over estimated this
6. Manage Governance Process - like stop changes happening or updating the architecture diagram that exists for any chans happening
7. Activate the Process to Implement Change - for any changes that are happening then implement the change

## Updates from Architecture Change Management

1. Architecture Updates (maintenance)
2. Change to architecture framework and principles (maintenance)
3. New Request for Architecture Work (for major changes)
4. Statement of architecture work (updated if necessary)
5. Architecture contract (updated if necessary)
6. Compliance assessments (updated if necessary)

## Artifacts Produced

None

Now ask the question - "Does the proposed change a new ADM cycle?" - like if change is big enough. This could be like new types of technologies like Augmented Reality etc.
