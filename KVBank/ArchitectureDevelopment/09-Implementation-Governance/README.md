# Architecture Development - Implementation Governance

## Purpose

1. Ensure conformance
2. Perform architecture governance

## Steps for Implementation Governace

1. Confirm Scope and Priorities for Deployment
2. Identify Deployment Resources and Skills
3. Guide Development of Solutions Deployment
4. Perform Enterprise Architecture Compliance Reviews
5. Implement Business and IT Operations
6. Perform Post-Implementation Review and Close the Implementation

## Outputs of Implementation Governace

1. Architecture Contract
- "...joint agreements between development partners and sponsors on the deliverables, quality and fitness-for-purpose of an architecture"
- Refer architecture framework's Fundamental Content Specification
2. Compliance assessments
3. Change requests
4. Architecture compliant solutions deployed
