# Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) Strategy

## Chief Architect’s Role

As Chief Architect, you:
- Define the **enterprise event-driven architecture blueprint** that supports scalability, responsiveness, and decoupled system interaction.
- Guide teams in adopting **asynchronous communication patterns** and integrating event flows with business processes.
- Establish **event taxonomy**, governance, and schema evolution policies.
- Enable event observability, replayability, and traceability to ensure system reliability and data integrity.
- Align EDA implementation with **domain-driven design (DDD)**, microservices architecture, and data platform strategies.

## Vision

To create a responsive, scalable, and loosely coupled enterprise architecture where services communicate through events—enabling real-time decision-making, extensibility, and faster innovation. EDA empowers teams to build systems that react to change as it happens, and to integrate at the speed of business.

## Strategic Principles

- **Asynchronous First**: Promote decoupled communication using events over tightly bound request-response interactions.
- **Domain-Aligned Events**: Structure events around business capabilities and bounded contexts.
- **Single Source of Truth**: Treat events as authoritative records of change, with clear ownership.
- **Event Contracts**: Enforce versioning, schema validation, and backward compatibility.
- **Observability & Governance**: Ensure event flows are monitored, auditable, and resilient.

## Strategic Objectives

- Define enterprise-wide event standards, naming conventions, and metadata requirements.
- Establish an event broker layer or event mesh using platforms like Kafka, Pulsar, or cloud-native alternatives.
- Enable event registry/catalog for discoverability and reuse.
- Integrate EDA into application and data modernization programs.
- Create patterns for event choreography, CQRS, and eventual consistency in system design.

## Execution Roadmap

| Phase       | Timeline | Key Deliverables |
|-------------|----------|------------------|
| **Foundation** | Q1       | Event modeling framework, reference architecture, broker selection |
| **Enablement** | Q2       | Schema registry, producer/consumer guidelines, DDD alignment |
| **Pilot & Scale**| Q3      | Event-driven services deployment, real-time data flows, audit/tracing |
| **Institutionalize**| Q4+  | EDA governance boards, catalog publishing, failure recovery patterns |

## KPIs & Metrics

- Number of event-driven services vs. total services
- Event delivery latency and throughput
- % of services with asynchronous interfaces
- Event schema versioning compliance rate
- Mean time to recover from event-related failure

## Strategic Patterns / Case Studies

- **Outbox Pattern**: Ensure reliable messaging from transactional systems.
- **Event Sourcing**: Persist state changes as a stream of immutable events.
- **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**: Separate read/write models for scalability.
- **Event Mesh**: Route and govern events across domains and hybrid/cloud environments.
